## Problem Statement:
In the rapidly evolving landscape of industrial automation, ensuring the reliable and efficient operation of equipment is of paramount importance. Industrial processes often rely on sensor data to monitor various parameters and maintain optimal performance. However, unexpected anomalies in this sensor data can lead to costly downtime, unsafe conditions, and decreased productivity. To address this critical challenge, our project aims to design a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm for detecting anomalies in sensor data from industrial equipment. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate anomaly detection system that can proactively identify deviations from normal behavior in real-time. By leveraging the power of deep learning techniques, we seek to create a model capable of understanding complex patterns within the sensor data and distinguishing between regular fluctuations and potentially harmful anomalies. This algorithm will empower industries to implement predictive maintenance strategies, minimize unplanned downtime, enhance safety protocols, and optimize overall operational efficiency. Throughout this endeavor, we will delve into the diverse realm of deep learning methodologies, exploring architectures such as auto encoders, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, we will emphasize the significance of data preprocessing and model optimization to ensure the highest level of accuracy and reliability. Our project aspires to contribute to the growing field of anomaly detection in industrial settings, fostering safer and more dependable operations across a wide range of sectors. 
## Data Design:
Data is the foundation of any successful anomaly detection system. Effective data design ensures the accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of the deep learning algorithm in detecting anomalies in sensor data from industrial equipment. This section outlines the key aspects of data design for the project, including the data model, data access mechanism, data retention policies, and data migration strategies.
## Data Model:
The data model defines the structure and relationships among the various data entities. For this project, the following entities are crucial:

*	SensorData -  This entity stores raw sensor readings collected from industrial equipment. It includes attributes such as timeStamp, sensor ID, equipment ID, and sensor readings. Proper indexing will facilitate efficient data retrieval.
*	EquipmentMetadata - This entity contains information about industrial equipment, such as name, location, and operational details. It establishes a link between sensor data and the corresponding equipment.
*	Anomalies - This entity records detected anomalies, including attributes like timeStamp, equipment ID, sensor ID, predicted anomaly score, and classification (true positive/false positive). This data is vital for evaluating algorithm performance.
*	ModelParameters - Storing hyper-parameters and configuration settings used during model training ensures reproducibility and future optimization.
*	Metrics - Entities like TrainingMetrics, ValidationMetrics, and TestMetrics store model performance metrics during training, validation, and testing stages.
